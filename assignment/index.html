        <li>
          Since, for in and for of loops are more concise than regular for loops, I'm 
          wondering when a for loop would be preferred? 
        </li>
        <li>
          In stretch goal 9, my initial while loop kept adding an extra 82nd box even 
          though that would mean that there were 574 parts and not 572. One fix I found
          added an if statement repeating the condition that there are 
          only 572 parts. Ultimately, I found a different solution, but
          why would I need to repeat that condition? Shouldn't defining the while exit 
          condition as a value equaling 572 cause it to exit?
