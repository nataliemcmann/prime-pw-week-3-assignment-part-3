    <main>
      <ol> 
        <li>
          Since, for in and for of loops are more concise than regular for loops, I'm 
          wondering when a for loop would be preferred? 
        </li>
        <li>
          In stretch goal 9, my initial while loop kept adding an extra 82nd box 
          because I had the stopping condition as less than 572. I'm still confused 
          as to why that didn't work?
